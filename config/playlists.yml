  Star Trek (Timeline Order):
    summary: Few film franchises have lasted as long as Star Trek. Through five decades and three different crews, the Star Trek films have saved more than a few worlds (and the whales), traveling through time more than once to do it. With them being set in so many different time periods, their actual chronological order might get a little confusing. No need to fret as this is the proper orderâ€¦ in linear time, anyway. On a quantum level is a whole other thing.
